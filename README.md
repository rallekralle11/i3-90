this is a reprap i designed.
inspired by the mendel90 and incorperating modified parts from that, the prusa mk2 and the mk3.
as well as a good few of my own design.

heads-up, this is the first printer i've ever designed.
i don't know git, don't know best practices and all that...

no mounting for electronics is included, exept i guess the massive sheets that would make a convenient hideaway.
just screw it into the wood, maybe make some nice covers. and that's that. 
i tried to keep the good amount of space from the mendel90.

the printing_assemply file is a list of what to print and a bit of a BOM.
the spoolholder file is the same, but for the spool holder i designed.

the frame pieces are intended for printing on multiple sheets and taping them together, 
then cutting out in whatever material you want. i used 19mm MDF. 
(slightly) overkill, but hey. i could stand on it without affecting the print.
thinner MDF would work well, OSB, maybe plastics... whatever you feel like.

the 13-90_assembly.123dx file can be opened in 123d or fusion360(though in fusion not everything works),
and is there to show how everything fits together.

any parts intended for the newer prusa i3s will most likely fit, since i've used the same rod spacings.
so if you want a bowden system, another leveling probe, hotend, fan, etc... there should be parts for that.
