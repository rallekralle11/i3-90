this is a reprap i designed.
inspired by the mendel90 and incorperating modified parts from that, the prusa mk2 and the mk3.
as well as a good few of my own design.

the printing_assemply file is a list of what to print and a bit of a BOM.
the spoolholder file is the same, but for the spool holder i designed.

the frame pieces are intended for printing on multiple sheets and taping them together, 
then cutting out in whatever material you want. i used 19mm MDF. 
(slightly) overkill, but hey. i could stand on it without affecting the print.
thinner MDF would work well, OSB, maybe plastics... whatever you feel like.

any parts intended for the newer prusa i3s will most likely fit, since i've used the same rod spacings.
so if you want a bowden system, another leveling probe, hotend, fan, etc... there should be parts for that.
