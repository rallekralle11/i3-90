this is designed with all the standard rod spacings of the newer i3s, any other bed carriage, print head, 
or other things for the mk2/mk3 would fit. i've used the mk2 X carriage since it doesn't need special parts.
(bondtech gears, IR filament sensor, magnets)
i apologise if something is missing, i've never designed a printer before. please tell me and i'll fix it.


frame:
the wooden pieces
8x mendel90/fixing_block
24x 4mm wood screws of appropriate length for the fixing blocks
i'd also recommend screwing the frame pieces together direcly if the material used is thick enough


bed assembly:
the wooden bed-holder-thingy
3x bearing clamps
Y_belt_attachment
Y_belt_clamp

2x M3x10 or slightly longer
16x 4mm wood screws of appropriate length(think i'll just shorten that to "wood screws" from now on)
3x LM8UU or equivalent
3 thin zip-ties
PCB bed or equivanent, i used an aluminium/PCB bed. standard hole spacing.
sheet of aluminium, steel, glass etc. if it's not integrated into the heater.
with glass the inductive probe wouldn't work


Y axis:
the bed assembly
Y_motor, if your base is thicker than around 19mm you may want to use Y_motor_extra, with another screw.
4x Y_rod_holder
Y_belt_slide
Y_slide_anchor
Y_endstop

4x M3x10 for the motor
2 or 3 wood screws for the motor mount
NEMA17 size motor(of course) with pulley
something like 80cm of belt, maybe more to be sure

9x wood screws for the rest
2 330mmx8mm rods
4 zip-ties (adjust the bearing spacing before attaching the rods)
a microswitch and small screws to mount it


X axis assembly:
X_carriage
X_end_idler
X_end_motor

7x LM8UU or equivalent, 6 of em can be replaced with 3 LM8LUU
motor and pulley
idler
3x M3x20 for the motor
another M3x20 or longer, and nut, for the tensioning thing
5x M3x20 with nuts for other things
maybe like 80cm of belt here too to be sure. just buy a 2m piece and you're good
2 370x8mm rods
2x lead screw nuts, or maybe normal M8 nuts in some fancy mounts. threaded rods are underrated
micro switch
6 zip-ties


Z axis:
good to know: the holes for the attachments can be made anywhere along the slits in the frame drawing, 
so longer or shorter motors can be used.
Z_top
Z_top_2
Z_bottom
Z_bottom_2


2x 8x320mm rods. maybe a couple mm shorter
2x lead screws of about the same length
2x NEMA17 size motors with couplers
8x M3x10 for the motors
don't forget to put on the X-assembly before screwing everything down
10x wood screws


extruder assembly:
extruder_body
extruder_cover
fan_nozzle
idler
idler_shaft

MK8 drive gear
625 bearing
12x M3 nuts
1x M3x18
1x M3x25
3x M3x20
2x M3x30
3x M3x40
2 suitable springs
(4 M3 washers)
(taken from the official prusa assembly guide, some parts have been modified)
E3D V6, lite6, clone or something like that
12mm inductive probe
30mm fan, or larger with a printed adapter
50mm radial blower fan

look at prusa's assembly guide, hex nuts work instead of square nuts
